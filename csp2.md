There are many different ways to implement a Client-Server Game Architecture. Depending on whether
you are building a table top turn based game, or an RTS, or an FPS, the exact features that need to be
implemented will change. This guide focuses on real time simulation, closer to that found in a FPS.
The architecture can be summarized as the following (adapted from Gabriel Gambetta):

  * Client connects and receives a full sync from the server
  * Server sends periodic sync messages to all connected clients
    * Clients use these to synchronize a clock
  * Clients send inputs to the server, with time stamps
    * the client simulates the inputs locally
  * Server process inputs and updats the world status
    * changes are included in the sync messages
  * Client processes the sync messages
    * syncs predicted state to the known state
    * interpolates known past state to the next state
    * extrapolates while waiting for the next state

From a playerâ€™s point of view, this has two important consequences:
  * Player sees himself in the present
  * Player sees other entities in the past



## interactive demos

1. Synchronized Clock

    Displays three panels representing two players and the server.
    The server has a clock which ticks upwards.
    Highlights the fact that clients are viewing the world in the past.

    TODO: add a pause button

2. fireworks
    allow changing latency only

3. movement
    basic top down adventure style movement system
    allow changing latency only

4. moving platform
    basic collision detection, physics
    include an elevator platform
    wheel only, up to jump, down to duck
    allow changing latency only

5. lag compensation
    player1 or player 2 have a button to be ai controlled
    players are space invaders ships pointed at each other
    and can only move left or right
    players have a button to shoot a bullet

demo features
    adjust latency between client<->server
    adjust input delay (constant at 6 normally)
    adjust % packet loss (webrtc is reliable)


## 1) Synchronized Clock

The first step in implementing a fast paced multiplayer server is to
have clocks synchronized between the client and the server.

The server side of the code is very simple. Every 100 milliseconds
send a message to all connected clients the current value of the local step.


server:
```typescript

class Server {

    constructor() {
        this.timer = 0.1
    }

    update(dt: float) {
        this.local_step += 1
        this.timer -= dt // subtract the delta since the last update
        if (this.timer < 0) { // check if the timer expired
            // send a message to all connected clients
            this.broadcast({type: "sync", step: this.local_step})
            this.timer += 0.1 // add 100ms to the timer
        }
    }

}

```

the client side is more tricky.
The client has a world step and a local step. Both are incremented
by one on every update step.

When the client receives the sync message, it updates the world step
to be the maximum of the receive value and the current value.

On every update, the client can compare the world step and the local step, and will
take action to try and synchronize the values. The values could be completely out of sync,
from a temporary network disconnect, in which case the client may request a full resync from the server
If the client is only a few frames behind, it may choose to run two updates in a row.
if the client is a few frames ahead, it may choose to skip an update.

This ensure that the client is synchronized with the server, but doesn't
take in to account lag in the network. to solve that, the client delays
inputs by 100ms. If the game is running at 60 ticks per second, then
the client local step should always be behind the world step by 6 steps.

```typescript
onSyncMessage(msg) {
    this.world_step = max(msg.step, this.world_step)
}

update(dt: float) {
    const delta = this.world_step - this.local_step
    const step_delay = 6
    if (delta > step_delay) {
        this.step()
        this.step()
    } else if (delta == step_delay) {
        this.step()
    } // else skip an update
}
```

This approach works well enough or a demo, but in practice, is a terrible way to implement this.
a better way would be to temporarily increase or decrease the framerate until the clocks are
synchronized again. Implementing some hysteresis to smooth out changes will also help, as
getting desynchronized by +/- one frame will be normal.

## 2) rest of the owl

Unfortunately, Multiplayer game development is a bit like drawing an owl. First draw two circles
stacked on top of each other, one a little longer than the other. Then draw the owl. QED. After
implementing a synchronized clock, there are a number of features that will need to be implemented
for smooth gameplay. The next few sections cover these topics:

  1. Sending and Receiving Messages
  2. Reconciliation - the process of handing late arriving messages
  3. Full Synchronization - sending the current state when a player connects
  4. Object Bending - the process of synchronizing predictions with authoritative state
  5. Partial Synchronization

every section
- highlevel explanation of topic
- problems that are trying to be solved

## 2.1) Receiving messages

1. Map Sync (full, partial, fragmentation)
2. Object Create
3. Object Input
4. Object Destroy
5. Reject Message

interpolation
    by sending only the user inputs and delaying by 100ms
    interpolate using past inputs, aka dead reckoning

## 2.2) Reconciliation

what happens if a message arrives late
You lined up a shot, the enemy is in your cross hairs, and you pull the trigger. But the message
for the player indicating they dodged out of the way is 1 frame late.

Reconcililatin is a process where the game state is rewound to apply late messages.
All steps are then run in sequence, to catch back up with the current time.

implement get/set state for the entity

implement get/set state for the world
the state is a dictionary mapping ObjectId => {object, state}

update_before
    pop input
    apply all input received for this step
update
update_after
    save state

## 2.3) Full Synchronization

a) full sync
b) partial sync

a) when a player joins mid way through, they will need to be sent the entire state of the game
b) do to floating point rounding errors, deltas will need to be periodically sent to clients

partial syncs are one solution to players with high ping
packets may be dropped because they are too old. the sync will update the client
to a known good starting point for applying new inputs.
the other possible solution is to make the receive buffer larger,
but this means reconciliation will need to be done over a larger window.
partial syncs reduce how many steps are needed for worst case reconciliation

partial syncs only need to be done for the same set of objects where bending could be used
bending may be disabled on the server

## 2.4) Bending

Bending is a process where the client prediction is synchronized with the authoritative server state over a number of frames.
This prevents the object from snapping to the correct position.
New messages are applied to objects during reconciliation, which may cause
entities to snap into the correct position. This can be quite jarring to a player as it looks
like objects are teleporting all over the screen.

Instead of applying messages directly to an entity during reconciliation,
the message are applied to a shadow copy. Then when reconciliation is completed
the shadow copy and the real object are gradually synchronized over a number of steps

- when a message is received that could trigger a reconciliation, keep track of the object id.
- once reconciliation begins create shadow copies of all dirty entities.
- if an object would be created during reconciliation, create a shadow copy as well
- during reconciliation apply inputs to entities. If the entity has a shadow, apply it to the shadow only
- When reconciliation ends, bend the object and its shadow over a number of steps

For simple objects bending can be a straight interpolation between the object and it's shadow.
For more complicated objects, that model not just speed, but acceleration it can be more tricky.
Regardless of the complexity, when bending finished the object should have
exactly the same state as the shadow object.

TODO: how to bend velocity and acceleration. (answer: the derivative should be smooth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerk_(physics))

next steps

* TODO: bending easing functions
* TODO: configurable bending steps
* TODO: bend newly created objects between their created position and their real time position this would create non -linear velocity issues for bullets, but can be solved in onBend

## 2.5) Partial Synchronization

remember that map-sync message implemented in step 1, and updated in step 2.3?

server is authoritative
so even if a future event comes in that is valid, causes a reconciliation
the next partial sync that is sent out is the truth
there is no contradiction

in a perfect world, partial syncs are not necessary. this is not that world
- packet loss
- floating point rounding errors
- cheaters and client side bugs: players may need to snap back to where the server says they are, if an input is rejected

are partial syncs position only?

## 7) delta syncs

## 6) Optimize Serialization

The simulator used to build the example games is cheating in a major way. It uses 4 lists as queues to
pass javascript objects between the 'clients' and the 'server'. In a real world game the objects
will need to be serialized for messages to be sent over the network.

Some options to reduce message size

- uses lists over dictionaries to represent object state. a list of ints can be serialized into a smaller payload than an object.
  - `[1,2]` vs `{x: 1, y:2}`
- use bjson, msgpack, or protobuf instead of JSON.stringify/JSON.load
- use zlib compression




## 7) Lag compensation

The server knows at what time each message was received, and can estimate the latency for each client.
This information can be used to rewind the state to what a particular player was actually seeing
at a specific point in time.

clients should send a special object-input message with a lag compensation flag
the message indicates that the server should perform lag compensation when processing
the message
e.g. if its a collision, look at the state history for the two characters


## 10)
split axertc_client in axertc_client and axertc_daedalus_client

## 10) other notes

the server can kill an object
clients can process damage, but should wait for the server to indicate an object actually died.

metric: number of updates per second
        ideally 1 update : 1 frame
        with reconciliation, it can be much more
        only reconcile on even frames?

metric: number of bytes incoming and outgoing per player
        query param to display this information
        use JSON.stringify and count
        for illustrative purposes pushing towards msgpack or something
